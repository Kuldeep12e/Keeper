# Keeper Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Keeper project, a secure and efficient data storage application built on the Internet Computer using the Motoko programming language. This README will guide you through setting up the project, understanding Motoko, and deploying it on the Internet Computer.

## Motoko Programming Language
Motoko is a programming language designed specifically for building applications on the Internet Computer. It offers a high-level, expressive syntax while ensuring strong security and efficiency properties. Here are some key features of Motoko:

- **Actor-based Model**: Motoko utilizes an actor-based concurrency model, allowing developers to write scalable and resilient distributed systems effortlessly.
  
- **Strong Typing**: Motoko features a strong type system that helps catch errors at compile-time, ensuring robustness and reliability of the code.
  
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Motoko abstracts away low-level memory management, providing automatic memory allocation and garbage collection, thus making it easier to write safe and efficient code.
  
- **Interoperability**: Motoko seamlessly integrates with other Internet Computer components, such as canisters and interfaces, enabling developers to build complex systems with ease.

For more information on Motoko and its features, refer to the [Motoko Documentation](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html).

## Internet Computer
The Internet Computer is a decentralized computing platform that enables the development and hosting of secure and scalable software on a public network. Here's why the Internet Computer is revolutionary:

- **Decentralization**: Unlike traditional cloud platforms, the Internet Computer is decentralized, meaning there's no single point of control, enhancing security and resilience.

- **Canister Model**: Applications on the Internet Computer are deployed as canisters, which are autonomous units of software that can interact with each other through a secure messaging protocol.

- **Security**: The Internet Computer leverages cryptographic techniques to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data, providing a secure environment for running applications.

- **Scalability**: With its unique architecture, the Internet Computer can scale transparently to accommodate growing demands without sacrificing performance or reliability.

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd keeper/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
